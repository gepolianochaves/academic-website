## Brazilian Mitochondrial DNA Sequences

Mitochondria are cellular organelles responsible for oxidizing glucose through the citric acid cycle. It is believed that this organelle was evolutionarily established as an organelle product of the symbiosis between eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic cells. Mitochondrial DNA is of maternal origin and is about 16,000 bp in size. The human mitochondrial DNA sequence is used in medical, forensic, and matrilineal investigations. 

In a population of European origin, mitochondrial variants are correlated with dementia and cognitive function in elderly people with Alzheimer's (Coskun, 2004; Tranah et al., 2012) and Parkinson's (Coskun 2012). Stonekin 2000 showed that germline and somatic mtDNA mutations preferentially occur at hypervariable sites, supporting the hypothesis that hypervariable sites are mutational hotspots (Stonekin 2000). It is believed that the matrilineal ethnic origin of Brazilians is approximately ⅓ African, ⅓ European and ⅓ Native American.

These approximate numbers are corroborations from studies such as those by Fridman (2014), who analyzed haplogroups of individuals from southeastern Brazil and showed that these Brazilian sequences were 36.9% Amerindian, 35.2% African and 27.6% European. Shen compared Chinese minorities to white and Hispanic Americans (Shen 2017). In this study we aim to compare the incidence of mitochondrial risk variants for dementia in the three matrilineal lineages of the Brazilian population based on the work initially presented by Alves-Silva et al., (2000). We also seek to establish databases to store information on Brazilian genetic variants for disease management, as did lmaizumi 2002.
