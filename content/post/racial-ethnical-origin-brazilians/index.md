## Construction of Racial Identity in Brazil

The social notion that human beings can be classified according to their ancestry or ethnical-racial characteristics exists in all human societies. Brazil has a mixed population resulting from contact between original indigenous peoples and peoples coming or brought to the national territory of Brazil. Portuguese colonizers arrived in Porto Seguro in the extreme south of Bahia in 1500. After contact between the Portuguese and native peoples, enslaved Africans were brought to the country, having a profound impact on the formation of Brazilian society. 

In 1808, with the arrival of the Portuguese royal family in Brazil, the ports were opened to “friendly nations” (England), foreshadowing the independence of 1822. As an independent country and with Empress Tereza Cristina as an Italian consort monarch, Brazil adopted a state policy to encourage (mainly) Italian immigration as a salaried substitute of enslaved labor. This phenomenon is pejoratively known as the whitening of Brazil.

The “whitening” of Brazil affected the country’s contemporary socioeconomic organization. Under Portuguese rule, the economic center of the colony was the Northeast. In the post-independence and (Italian) immigration to São Paulo, the Southeast and South became the most important economic center of Brazil. Therefore, Brazilian socioeconomic, regional and historical differences can be understood based on the ethnical-racial components of the formation and construction of the country.

Recent results on the impact of Brazilian ethnical-racial composition revealed that ethnical-racial discrimination correlates with indicators of morbidity in the Brazilian population. The Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brazil) showed the relationship between race/color, racial discrimination and the incidence of obesity. These results showed that it is necessary to study the impact of ethnical-racial identity and genetics on the health of Brazilians, to better understand the causes of higher incidence of obesity among black individuals. To this end, the present proposal aims to develop computational methods for quantifying phenotypes that can be used in the genetic analysis of Brazilians, initially in public data and later data from individuals that interested, considering the the public health interest of the society of Brazil. In order to do that we start by studying mitochondrial genomics in Brazilian individuals.
