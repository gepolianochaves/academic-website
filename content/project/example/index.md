#### Objectives of the GERALDO virtual environment

Our objectives in developing this tool are to apply Artificial Inteligence, Machine Learning, Data Science and Bioinformatics algorithms to genomic information from samples of Brazilian ancestry to calculate risk, phenotype, diagnostic and prognostic scores and probabilities for this population. We hope that GERALDO will be used by the public health system of Brazil including the integration with the DATASUS database and Programa Genomas Brasil (GenBR).
